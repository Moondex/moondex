# MoonDEX Coin Masternode Installation Script
## Overview
Shell script to install a `MoonDEX Coin Masternode` on a Linux server running Ubuntu 16.04. Supports IPv4 and multiple nodes on a single VPS.  IPv6 is supported by the script, but the current MoonDEX wallets do not support IPv6.  This script does not configure your VPS's iptables entries and will require separate install steps (see instructions) to make additional masternodes work correctly if you install more than one.

### IMPORTANT:
```
Make sure you read all the instructions below before using this script, it does _not_ install your masternode under the root account and as such requires different commands than most other scripts
```

### Summary of steps
1. Configure VPS to have one IP for each MDEX MN being installed on it (through VPS provider).
2. Set up the first masternode and let it sync.
3. Configure your local wallet (GUI wallet) to work with the MN and start the new MN in the local wallet.
4. Confirm successful startup of the MN
5. Repeat from step 2 (above) for each additional MDEX masternode

&nbsp;


## 1. Configuring your Masternode Collateral and Rewards Address
In your local wallet (typically a GUI wallet in Windows, etc.)
1. Make sure you have downloaded the latest wallet from https://github.com/Moondex/MoonDEXCoin/releases
1. Install the wallet on your local PC
1. Start the wallet and let it completely synchronize to the network - this will take some time
1. Create a new Receiving Address from the wallet's *File* menu and name it appropriately, e.g. MN-1
1. Unlock your wallet (if necessary) and send _exactly_ 2,500 MDEX to the address created above
1. Wait for a minimum of 15 confirmations before starting the masternode in the GUI (see steps below).  In the meanwhile, you can proceed with the following steps.
1. Open your wallet's *Debug Console* and type: `masternode outputs`.  Record the reported *transaction ID* and *transaction output index* for the new MN.  These should be a long series of characters, followed by a single digit (each in double quotes).
1. Open your *masternode configuration file* from the wallet's *Tools* menu item.
1. In the masternodes.conf file, add an entry that looks like: [address-name from above] [ip:port of your VPS from script output] [privkey from script output] [txid from from above] [tx output index from above] -
Your *masternodes.conf* file entry should look like: **MN-1 127.0.0.2:8906 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2jcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 1** and it must be all on one line in your masternodes config file
1. Save and close your *masternodes.conf* file
1. Close your wallet and restart it.
1. Proceed with the VPS setup (you can proceed even if the confirmations have not yet reached 15).


## 2. Prepare VPS for the Masternode(s)
1. Create new VPS (for example, on VULTR) using Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit and IPv4
1. Record the VPS info (Label, IP, login, pswd, etc.)
1. On the "Settings" tab (assuming the VPS is on VULTR) select the IPv4 settings and Add Another IPv4 Address button. You can find instructions on adding the additional IP address in the VULTR help docs at: https://www.vultr.com/docs/add-secondary-ipv4-address
1. Record the new (additional) IP address.
1. Log into the new VPS using Putty (or similar)
1. Back on the VULTR IPv4 settings page, locate and click on the link for *networking configuration*.  This will bring you to a page that is auto-generated (customized) to give you the exact text that you can copy/paste into the file `/etc/network/interfaces` on your VPS using an editor like `nano` (available on most Ubuntu VPSs).  You should not have to tweak anything in the copied text (itâ€™s pretty simple).  Make sure to copy the text from the example code section for *Ubuntu 16.xx*.  For this example (two MNs using two IPv4 addresses), this looks something like:
```auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto ens3
iface ens3 inet static
	address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
	netmask 255.255.254.0
	gateway XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
	dns-nameservers XXX.XX.XX.XX
	post-up ip route add XXX.XXX.0.0/16 dev ens3

iface ens3 inet6 static
	address XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX
	netmask 64
	dns-nameservers XXXX:XXXX:XXX:XXXX::X

auto ens3:1
iface ens3:1 inet static
	address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
	netmask 255.255.254.0
```


## 3. Installation
To start the installation, login as `root` to your VPS and run the two commands listed below. Note that the masternode _does not run as root_ but as a user that the script will create. The installation script, however, needs to run as root so your VPS can be configured correctly.

```
wget -q https://github.com/click2install/moondex/raw/master/install-moondex.sh  
bash install-moondex.sh
```
This script is intended to be used on a clean server, or a server that has used this script to install 1 or more previous MDEX nodes.  It may also work on a VPS with masternodes of other coins, but that may involve additional measures that are beyond the scope of these instructions (give it a shot if you want, but be prepared to troubleshoot).

This script will install the masternode binaries (executable files) `moondexd` and `moondex-cli` into the common directory `/usr/local/bin`.



## How to setup your masternode with this script and a cold wallet on your PC
The script assumes you are running a cold wallet on your local PC and this script will execute on a Ubuntu Linux VPS (server). The steps involved are:

 1. Run the masternode installation script as per the [instructions above](https://github.com/click2install/moondex#installation).
 2. When you are finished this process you will get some information on what has been done as well as some important information you will need for your cold wallet setup.
 3. **Copy/paste the output of this script into a text file and keep it safe.**

You are now ready to configure your local wallet and finish the masternode setup

 1. Make sure you have downloaded the latest wallet from https://github.com/Moondex/MoonDEXCoin/releases
 2. Install the wallet on your local PC
 3. Start the wallet and let if completely synchronize to the network - this will take some time
 4. Create a new `Receiving Address` from the wallets `File` menu and name it appropriately, e.g. MN-1
 5. Unlock your wallet and send **exactly 2,500 MDEX** to the address created in step #4
 6. Wait for the transaction from step #5 to be fully confirmed. Look for a tick in the first column in your transactions tab
 7. Once confirmed, open your wallet console and type: `masternode outputs` **or use the generated private key from the script**
 8. Open your masternode configuration file from the wallets `Tools` menu item.
 9. In your masternodes.conf file add an entry that looks like: `[address-name from #4] [ip:port of your VPS from script output] [privkey from script output] [txid from from #7] [tx output index from #7]` -
 10. Your masternodes.conf file entry should look like: `MN-1 127.0.0.2:8906 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0` and it must be all on one line in your masternodes config file
 11. Save and close your masternodes.conf file
 12. Close your wallet and restart
 13. Go to Masternodes > My MasterNodes
 14. Make sure the VPS node is fully synchronised and at the correct block height before trying to activate it from the wallet.
 15. Click the row for the masternode you just added
 16. Right click > Start Alias
 17. Your node should now be running successfully, wait for some time for it to connect with the network and the `Active` time to start counting up.

## Multiple master nodes on one server
The script allows for multiple nodes to be setup on the same server, using the same IP address and different ports. It also allows for either IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses to be used.

During the execution of the script you have the opportunity to decide on a port to use for the node. Each node runs under are different user account which the script creates for you.

**Important:** when installing more than one masternode, make sure the port number you choose is above 1024 and at least 2 greater than any other node you have running. It needs to be 2 as the masternode uses the port you enter and the masternode rpcserver uses the next highest port.

The easiest ports to choose would be 8906 for your first masternode, then 8908, 8910. The RPC port will be chosen based on your port selection.

At this stage the script auto detects the IP addresses of the server, if there is more than one address found, it will ask you which address to use, otherwise it will use the only address found without user input.

If you do setup multiple masternodes on a single VPS, make sure the VPS is capable of running more than one masternode or your masternode rewards will suffer. **You have been warned.**

Once you have setup the 2nd or more masternodes, use the output of the script for each masternode and follow the [steps above](https://github.com/click2install/moondex#how-to-setup-your-masternode-with-this-script-and-a-cold-wallet-on-your-pc) in your wallet, where each new masternode is a new line in your `masternode.conf` file. **NOTE:** All the port numbers in your masternode.conf file will be 8906 or the wallet will not re-start after you save the config file.

Note that multiple masternodes use only one instance of the `moondexd` and `moondex-cli` binary files located in `/usr/local/bin` and they each have their own configuration located in `/home/<username>/.moondexcore` folder.

&nbsp;


## Running the script
When you run the script it will tell you what it will do on your system. Once completed there is a summary of the information you need to be aware of regarding your node setup which you can copy/paste to your local PC. **Make sure you keep this information safe for later.**

If you want to run the script before setting up the node in your cold wallet the script will generate a priv key for you to use, otherwise you can supply the privkey during the script execution by pasting it into the SSH shel [right click for paste] when asked.

&nbsp;


## Masternode commands
Because the masternode runs under a user account, you cannot login as root to your server and run `moondex-cli masternode status` (or other commands the "usual way"), if you do you will get an error. You need to switch the to the user that you installed the masternode under when running the script. **So make sure you keep the output of the script after it runs.**

You can query each of your masternodes by first switching to the user the masternode is running as:
```
 su - <username>
```

If you are asked for a password, it is in the script output you received when you installed the masternode, you can right click and paste the password.
The following commands can then be run against the node that is running as the user you just switched to.

#### To query your masternodes status
```
 moondex-cli masternode status
```

#### To query your masternode information
```
 moondex-cli getinfo
```

#### To query your masternodes sync status
```
 moondex-cli mnsync status
```

## Removing a masternode and user account
If something goes wrong with your installation or you want to remove a masternode, you can do so with the following command.
```
 userdel -r <username>
```
This will remove the user and its home directory. If you then re-run the installation script you can re-use that username.

&nbsp;

## Security
The script will set up the required firewall rules to only allow inbound node communications, whilst blocking all other inbound ports and all outbound ports.

The [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) package is also used to mitigate DDoS attempts on your server.

Despite this script needing to run as `root` you should secure your Ubuntu server as normal with the following precautions:

 - disable password authentication
 - disable root login
 - enable SSH certificate login only

If the above precautions are taken you will need to `su root` before running the script. You can find a good tutorial for securing your VPS [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04).
